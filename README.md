## Running the Game
### Option 1: Using the `run.sh` Script
1. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. (Optional step) make script executable
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
```
3. Run the `run.sh` script to launch the game:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```
### Option 2: Running Commands Manually
#### Linux/Mac:
1. Navigate to the root directory of your project in the terminal.
2. Create a file named `sources.txt` that lists all the `.java` files:
   ```bash
   find src -type f -name "*.java" > sources.txt
   ```
3. Compile all the `.java` files listed in `sources.txt` and output them to a `compiled` directory:
   ```bash
   javac -d compiled @sources.txt
   ```
4. Copy all resource files (excluding `.java` files) to the `compiled` directory while preserving the directory structure:
   ```bash
   rsync -av --exclude="*.java" src/resources compiled
   ```
5. Delete the `sources.txt` file to clean up:
   ```bash
   rm sources.txt
   ```
6. Navigate to the `compiled` directory:
   ```bash
   cd compiled
   ```
7. Run the game:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

#### Windows (Command Prompt):
1. Open Command Prompt (or Windows Terminal) and navigate to your project directory.
2. Create a file named `sources.txt` with the paths of all `.java` files:
   ```cmd
   dir /s /b src\*.java > sources.txt
   ```
3. Compile all `.java` files listed in `sources.txt` into a `compiled` directory:
   ```cmd
   javac -d compiled @sources.txt
   ```
4. Copy all resource files (excluding `.java` files) to the `compiled\resources` directory:
   ```cmd
   xcopy /e /i src\resources compiled\resources
   ```
5. Delete the `sources.txt` file to clean up:
   ```cmd
   del sources.txt
   ```
6. Navigate to the `compiled` directory:
   ```cmd
   cd compiled
   ```
7. Run the game:
   ```cmd
   java Main
   ```

## Codebase Overview
- The code is structured to be intuitive, with method names clearly describing their purpose.
- While there are minimal comments above methods, the focus on readability ensures that understanding the functionality is straightforward.
- Most configuration values are stored in the `Enums` or `Constants` class to avoid hard-coded values. However, there are still a few hard-coded values that will be addressed in future iterations.
- Development utilities such as `drawAttackBox` and `drawHitbox` methods are present in the codebase but are not used in the final version. These were utilized during development and have been retained for potential debugging or enhancements.

## Asset and Inspiration Credits
- **Tutorial Inspiration**: This game was inspired by the Java platformer tutorial provided by [Kaarin Gaming](https://www.kaaringaming.com/).
- **Visual Assets**:
    - Some sprites were sourced from [Luiz Melo's Monsters Creatures Fantasy](https://luizmelo.itch.io/monsters-creatures-fantasy).
    - Additional character sprites from [RV Ros' Animated Pixel Hero](https://rvros.itch.io/animated-pixel-hero).
- **Audio**:
    - Background music for levels and menu was taken from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/).
- **Image Editing**:
    - Pixel art updates were made using [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/).

---

## Known Issues
- A small number of values remain hard-coded and will require refactoring for full configurability.
- When running the game from the linux command line(at least subsystem for Windows), **audio clips are not loaded correctly**. This issue remains unresolved and is planned for future work.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add more comments for methods where additional context might be beneficial.
- Refactor remaining hard-coded values into enums or constants.
- Address the command-line audio loading issue.
- Implement additional gameplay features for enhanced user engagement.
